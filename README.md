  *This RESTful API enables users to securely log, manage, and analyze their skydiving jumps, with role-based access for regular users and admins. <br> 
  Built with Java Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL (development) and H2 (testing), it implements JWT authentication with custom Spring Security filters and services. <br>
  The API supports search, pagination, and dashboard statistics, while a lightweight frontend built with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap & CSS allows users to register, log in, create jumps, and view their jump history. <br>
  Spring Boot Integration tests and JUnit, Mockito ensure 95% code coverage, for a reliable foundation for further planned features, including Swagger documentation and Docker deployment.*
